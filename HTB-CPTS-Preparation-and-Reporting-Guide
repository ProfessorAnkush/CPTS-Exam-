# HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) – Complete Preparation & Success Guide

This repository is my personal collection of notes, strategies, resources, and especially reporting guidance for passing the **Hack The Box Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS)** certification in 2025–2026.

I passed CPTS after failing once (report got rejected even with 13/14 flags 😅), so everything here comes from real pain and lessons learned. This is **not** a walkthrough — it's methodology, mindset, and especially why reporting is make-or-break.

**Last updated:** January 2026

## Why This Repo Exists

HTB CPTS is hands-down one of the toughest intermediate-level pentest certs right now.  
Many people say it's harder than OSCP in certain ways — especially because:

- 10-day practical exam on a real enterprise-like AD environment
- You need ~12–14 flags (user + root/system)
- **You must submit a commercial-grade professional report**
- Even if you pwn everything, bad reporting = instant fail

I saw too many talented hackers fail just because their report looked like OSCP-style bullet points or lacked executive polish. That's why 40% of this guide is about reporting.

## Exam Overview & Requirements

- **Format**: 10 consecutive days, black-box pentest
- **Environment**: Enterprise simulated network (web apps → foothold → internal pivot → AD domination)
- **Objectives**: Obtain as many flags as possible (usually need 12+/14)
- **Submission**: Full professional report (PDF) + flags proof
- **Grading**: Technical + Report quality (both must pass)
- **Cost**: ~$210 voucher (after 100% Penetration Tester path)
- **Result time**: Up to 20 business days
- **Official page**: https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist

## Prerequisites – What You Actually Need

Must complete **100%** of HTB Academy **Penetration Tester Job Role Path** (~28 modules, 1980+ cubes).  
Especially finish these:

- Documentation & Reporting
- Attacking Enterprise Networks
- Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks
- **Owen** module (legendary – many say it's exam-like)

If you skip any, you're wasting your voucher.

## Study Plan – 3 to 8 Month Roadmap

**Month 1–2** — Finish Penetration Tester path (do every lab & skill assessment)  
**Month 3** — Re-do weak modules + start pro labs / seasons  
**Month 4–5** — Heavy AD practice (BloodHound, Impacket, Rubeus, Certipy)  
**Month 6** — Report writing practice (write fake reports from retired machines)  
**Month 7+** — Simulate 5–7 day exam runs on hard AD sets

Daily: 2–4 hours. Take breaks — burnout kills more attempts than skill gaps.

## Key Topics & Hardest Parts

- Web → Foothold (usually hard/insane difficulty web vuln chaining)
- Pivoting & tunnelling ( chisel / ligolo-ng )
- Windows / Linux priv esc
- **Active Directory** (Kerberoast, AS-REP, delegation abuses, DCSync, Golden/Silver tickets)
- Post-exploitation (credential harvesting, persistence)
- **Outside-the-box thinking** — rarely one vuln = root

## Exam Strategy – During the 10 Days

1. Day 1–2: Recon everything. Don't rush foothold.
2. Take **copious notes** from minute 1 (commands, outputs, screenshots).
3. Use **SysReptor** or CherryTree live during exam.
4. Chain vulns — expect rabbit holes.
5. Sleep 7–8 hrs every night — fatigue = stupid mistakes.
6. Days 8–10: Focus only on report writing.

## Why Reporting Skills Matter So Much

In real pentests, **the report is the only deliverable the client sees**.  
A great hack with a trash report = zero business value.

HTB knows this — they simulate **commercial reality**.

- Bad report → client ignores findings → no fix → breach later
- Good report → clear risk communication → budget approved → secure org

CPTS tests if you're **market-ready**, not just a script kiddie who can run exploits.

Many fail CPTS **not** because of flags, but because:

- No executive summary
- Screenshots too small / missing PoC code output
- No proper risk rating (CVSS / business impact)
- Typos, bad structure, missing remediation
- Looks like OSCP-style wall-of-text instead of professional consulting deliverable

HTB has gotten stricter — recent fails even with 14 flags if report is "not thorough enough".

## How to Write a Passing CPTS Report

Use **SysReptor** (official HTB template exists — highly recommended).

Structure I used (passed second attempt):

1. **Cover Page** – Clean, professional
2. **Statement of Confidentiality**
3. **Executive Summary** (non-technical, 1–2 pages, business language)
4. **Table of Contents**
5. **Introduction & Methodology**
6. **Scope & Rules of Engagement**
7. **High-Level Findings Summary** (table with severity)
8. **Detailed Technical Findings** (one per vuln)
   - Title
   - Severity (Critical/High/Med/Low)
   - CWE / CVE if applicable
   - Affected assets
   - Description
   - Proof of Concept (full command + output + screenshot)
   - Impact (business + technical)
   - Remediation / recommendation
   - References
9. **Conclusion & Overall Risk**
10. **Appendix** (full logs if needed)

Tips:

- Screenshots: High-res, annotated, visible text
- Code blocks: Full commands + output (not truncated)
- Language: Professional, no slang
- Length: 50–90 pages usually passes (quality > quantity)
- Proofread 3×

## Recommended Tools & Templates

- **SysReptor** → https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor (HTB CPTS template)
- CherryTree / Obsidian for live notes
- BloodHound CE
- Impacket, CrackMapExec, Certipy, Rubeus
- Chisel / SSHuttle / Ligolo-ng for pivoting

## Practice Resources & Labs

- HTB Pro Labs: Dante, Offshore, APTLabs
- Retired machines: Forest, Sauna, Blackfield, etc.
- TJNull list filtered for AD/web
- Seasons boxes

## Common Fails & Lessons Learned

- Rushing report in last 2 days
- Missing business impact explanation
- Tiny / cropped screenshots
- No proper chaining explanation
- Assuming reviewer knows your thought process — spell it out

## FAQ & Final Motivation

**Q: Is CPTS harder than OSCP?**  
A: Technical side — similar or harder. Reporting — much stricter.

**Q: Worth it in 2026?**  
A: Yes — respected, AD-focused, cheaper than OSCP, great learning.

You got this bro — grind smart, document everything, write like you're briefing a CISO.
